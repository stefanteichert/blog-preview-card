## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- VS Code
- Figma Desktop App


### What I learned

In this project, I learned the importance of box-sizing and custom fonts for accurate layout:

- Box-sizing (border-box) ensures that padding and borders are included in an element’s width, making layouts predictable and easier to center, especially for cards.

- Custom fonts (@font-face) allow using local TTF files (Medium & ExtraBold), ensuring font-weights match the design exactly without relying on external sources.
